Pulling a baseline  from AutoCM archive server to local. Two Methods
This documentation will guide you in pulling a baseline(ear/war/tar) files from the AutoCM archive servers to your local and also adding a file to  the remote path location to the server.
There are two ways to pull files from the Archive serves. One is through the web browser and downloading the file directly from the Archive servers. The other way is through WinSCP.
The main purpose of this documentation is to help you while performing  Manual deployments  in web console / Moving files from any where to any where. 
Transfeering files direectly from the Archive servers:

1.	Find what baseline you need to transfer file from
 

2.	Retrieve baseline tar file from one of the Archive servers r1pvap1127 or r3pvap1074. You will use the following syntax. Note – You will need to authenticate to the firewalls to access the URLs.
http://r1pvap1127:8080/archive/Baseline_ID/
http://r3pvap1074:8080/archive/Baseline_ID/
For this example the baseline we are retrieving equals - WIDGET_EMIDIO_170621145748
The URLS would be as follows – 
http://r1pvap1127:8080/archive/WIDGET_EMIDIO_170621145748/
http://r3pvap1074:8080/archive/WIDGET_EMIDIO_170621145748/
You can use either Archive to download the tar file.

3.	Once you load the URL you can select and download the tar file to your desktop.
 

4.	Download file
 

5.	Tar file is now located on your computer to be used for manual deployment.
 




Transfeering files Using WinSCP

Tools used
1. TPAM to generate credentials to required server
2. WinSCP to transfer files from / to any location
Steps Involved:
1.	Select the AutoCM build archive servers from which you need to pull the required baselines to your local system.  r1pvap1127, r3pvap1074.
2.	Generate the TPAM password for that particular archive  servers.
3.	Logon to WinSCP. Provide the Host name. Provide the TPAM generated User name and  Password and click on Login.

 


The below WinSCP window prompts once we click on login.
 

4.	The left portion  is your local and right portion  is the archive server file systems.

 

5.	Select /<root > from the right portion top. Go to escm/ acm/acm_archive  (here is where all the applications respective (ear/war/tar)   files are present)
  
6.	All the applications are hosted under the acm_archive. Browse for the required application and select the ear/war/tar file that needs to be moved to your local system or Select F5 to transfer the required tar file from server to local.
 











Transfering  (ear/war/tar) from your local to remote path into the server:
1.	Click on the new Session from the below WinSCP screen or open new WinSCP  and  provide TPAM credentials for the required server where you need place the (ear/war/tar)  .
 
This can be achieved in two ways.
1.	Select the particular file from the local(left side) and press F5 to tranfer to required destination into the remote path(Server)
2.	Drag and drop the required file to the necessary location.
    Ex: /home/dabroyle
