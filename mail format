If you want us to make the changes in harvest, again we have to do the porting from harvest to stash which will take lot of time and effort.

Hi Abhinandh,

We had a discussion with Lonnie, previously we used to capture parameters for ESCM_BAMS-CADRE_DEV through Websphere console at the time of manual deployment and update that in script but here Lonnie updated that for ESCM_BAMS-CADRE_DEV_LIB the manual deployment will happen through Liberty Admin Center https://r3dvap1062.1dc.com:9044/adminCenter/ (wasn’t able to login with 1dc and webdep credentials). But he wasn’t sure of the steps for manual deployment through this liberty console.

In SR-4211 the component name is mentioned as BAMS-CADRE_BACKEND_LIBERTY which is not there in ACM. Actually the component is BAMS-CADRE_BACKEND only but now from a new branch named Development_Liberty in stash, App team is trying to build and deploy to new environment named ESCM_BAMS-CADRE_DEV_LIB with new target path /opt/bams-cadre/bams-cadre_backend/liberty. (The existing ESCM_BAMS-CADRE_DEV has to remain as it is and new one will be an addition to the existing one)

Can you please check on this as to how this liberty console deployment can be accommodated.


Hi Bharathi,

Hi Lonnie,

I see the build 685322  has failed with the branch - Development_Liberty. Once the build is successful, we have to proceed with the manual deployment to capture parameters and include them in the Deployment script to automate the deployment process.


Hi Team,

REQ000002766092 was cancelled .

Reason mentioned as “Please raise separate requests, maximum 6 servers per request, create separate request for prod and non-prod, in your request, we could see all environment servers in one request .
please raise separate request for each cluster pair and if it is standalone 4 servers per request.”


Hi Kranthi

MM_CONFIG component is in Gerrit not yet migrated to Stash and also few components are in gerrit.

Please let us know the component name which are in gerrit. So that we can migrate  to Stash.

MM_CONFIG is configured with “mm”  product id in gerrit. So we can migrate to stash and will  change the product id to “merchantmanager”.

So that we can avoid the build and deployment issue.

Hi Team,

Three applications have reported that even if they try to build from the branch, AutoCM is building the code from master:-

•         NSS_VoltageETLTool – They did not have build folder in the ‘master’ due to which build was failing – DBID – 688689. So we suggested them to merge the code to master and trigger build. Now the build is successful. DBID – 688715
•          BAMS_MS_APP_NEW – Build triggered with master (DBID - 688717), branch - feature/FORTIFYFIX (DBID - 688694) , branch - bugfix/Voltage  (DBID - 688732) where all of them has the master content.
•         AFPGUI_BCH – Build triggered with Branch (DBID – 688729) which has the content of master (DBID – 686457).

Please have a look on this issue.

Send an email with the attached document and include On-Boarding team in a mail chain. Check with Muthu if a KT session can be arranged.
