CR APPROVAL
AutoCM deployment CR approval:

Go to ESCM PortalPending
Step1: Provide CR number (CRQ000000171745) in Record #  field . 
Note: if you are not able to find the CR in our queue, tell requestor to add Implementation task for our team (X2GDS_DistAppDeploy).
 
Step2: Click on   icon, it will redirect to CR Validation Checker page.
Note: Validation Checker should always be in passed state, if status is failed in AutoCM - Mail/MOC to requestor to add correct environment and baseline in BMC Remedy.
 Multiple Environments and Baseline should be separated by colon ( : ). No other separators are allowed and without colon AutoCM will fail to recognize the Environment and baseline.
 
Step3: check the previous  deployment went successful or not.
Go to Status deploy
Note:  if the CR is going for first time deployment  means, send out a mail to onboarding team to check the ssh connectivity and deployment path.
 

 

Step4: take the server list for given environment
Go to Project SetupView
Give component name and select Update Config version and check the server list for given environment.
 
Step5: Open the Autocm Agent ID (r3pvap1070/ r1pvap1124)   to check the space and ssh connectivity.
Step6: Switch to su - webdep

 

Step7: Verify ssh connectivity and space from AutoCM Agent ID (r3pvap1070/ r1pvap1124)   to all target system ID's through scp using below scripts.

list=" r1pvap1331 r1pvap1332 r3bvap1125 r3bvap1126"
for x in $list
do
echo "SSH connectivity check for $x"
scp acm/acm_test/testFile webdep@${x:?}:/tmp
echo
echo "Space availability for $x"
ssh ${x:?} df -h /opt/escm || ssh ${x:?} df -h /home/webdep || ssh ${x:?} df -h /export/home/webdep
echo
done
 
 
Note: Verify the space on the target server for /opt/escm or /home/webdep files system. If the space is occupied above 80% clear some space on the target servers. If we are unable to clear the spaces for /opt/escm or /home/webdep file system , contact to the application team.

Step8: in BMC Remedy check the iplan is attached or not
 

Step9: iPlan should have both implementation task and Backout task for our team (TMDSM/X2GDS_DistAppDeploy).
 
Step10:Attach the document  of the space and ssh connectivity checked in servers.
 
Step11: Approve the CR  by clicking the “ Approve”  button.
